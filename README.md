# rrt
Collection of rrt-based algorithms that scale to n-dimensions:
- rrt
- rrt* (rrt-star)
- rrt* (bidirectional)
- rrt* (bidriectional, lazy shortening)
- rrt connect

Utilizes [R-trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree) to improve performance by avoiding point-wise collision-checking and distance-checking.

## Requirements
- [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Rtree](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Rtree/)
- [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/) (only needed for plotting)

## Usage
Define an n-dimensional Search Space, and n-dimensional obstacles within that space. Assign start and goal locations as well as the number of iterations to expand the tree before testing for connectivity with the goal, and the max number of overall iterations.

### Search Space
Assign bounds to Search Space in form: `[(x_lower, x_upper), (y_lower, y_upper), ...]`

### Start and Goal
Points represented by tuples of form: `(x, y, ...)`

### Obstacles
Axis-aligned (hyper)rectangles represented by a tuples of form `(x_lower, y_lower, ..., x_upper, y_upper, ...)`

Non-axis aligned (hyper)rectangles or other obstacle representations should also work, provided that `collision_free` and `obstacle_free` are updated to work with the new obstacles.

### Resolution
Assign resolution of edges:
- `q`: Distance away from existing vertices to probe.
- `Q`: Array of tuples, where each tuple corresponds to (distance q, number of times to try distance q). Will iterate through all tuples until a solution is found or the max number of samples is hit. Intended for situations where you want to try various lengths of `q`. Otherwise can just use a single base case such as `(q, 1)`.
- `r`: Discretization length to use for edges when sampling along them to check for collisions. Higher numbers run faster, but may lead to undetected collisions.

### Examples
Visualization examples can be found for rrt and rrt* in both 2 and 3 dimensions.
